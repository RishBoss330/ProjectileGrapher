# ProjectileGrapher
A grapher developed using matplotlib that graphs projectile motion against its axes of x and y velocities. 

Some guidelines before using the project:
1. For the purposes of simplicity, the value of acceleration due to gravity has been taken as g = 9.81 m/s^2
2. The units of all values are SI units, except for the angle input which is in degrees which is converted to radians through the numpy conversion algorithm


In order to install matplotlib, use the following code:

Open the terminal of your device, or the terminal of your python IDE and enter

pip3 install matplotlib

Once done, the matplotlib libraries will self install.
